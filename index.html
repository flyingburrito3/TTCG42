    <div class="center-justified"><h4>Is 42 the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?</h4></div>
  
    <div class="center-justified1"><p>In Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a super intelligent race of beings builds a computer, called Deep Thought, to get an answer to the universe’s ultimate question: “What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?”, and in response to this question Deep Thought gives a very simple and supposedly off the wall answer: “42”.</p>

    <p>Well, according to the author: "The answer to this is very simple," Adams said. "It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base 13, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat on my desk, stared in to the garden and thought 42 will do. I typed it out. End of story."</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, millions of Hitchhiker's fans to this day persist in trying to decipher what they imagine was Adams' secret motivations. Douglas Adams spent part of his time in school and professional life as a computer programmer.
    <strong>The primary programming language at the time was ASCII.
    In computer programming, the asterisk (*) is a symbol that represents a wildcard, a variable input by the end user and not by the computer program. The asterisk can mean literally anything. As the end user, the asterisk/variable gains the meaning you give it.</strong></p>

    <p>This brings us back to Deep Thought’s answer. Deep Thought answers in the only language it knows, it says “42” giving life an equivalent meaning to that of a variable or wildcard. In essence, Deep Thought is saying that the meaning of life is whatever you want it to be.</p>
